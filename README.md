# Kustomize:  🚀

Welcome to Kustomize learning! This guide will help you learn Kustomize step by step, using simple examples and clear explanations.

## What is Kustomize?
Kustomize helps you change Kubernetes files without editing them directly. Think of it like cooking:
- You have a basic recipe (we call this the base)
- You want to make small changes (we call these overlays)
- You don't need to change the original recipe!

1. Start with the basics folder
2. Try each example yourself
3. Move to the next topic when you feel ready
4. Each folder has its own README with examples
